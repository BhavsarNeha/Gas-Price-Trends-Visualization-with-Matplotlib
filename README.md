# Gas Price Trends Visualization with Matplotlib

## Project Overview

This project visualizes global gas price trends using Python's `matplotlib` library. It includes two main parts:

1. **Basic Line Plot**: Demonstrates a simple line plot showing the relationship between `x` and `y`, where `y` is a function of `x`. It explores customizations like line styles, markers, and colors.

2. **Gas Prices Over Time**: Visualizes gas prices for different countries over time using data from a CSV file (`gas_prices.csv`). The plot compares trends across countries like the USA, Canada, South Korea, and Australia.

## Features

- **Custom Plotting**: Explore custom line styles, colors, markers, and labels.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Load data from a CSV file and plot multiple trends on one graph.

- **Save Plots**: Save your visualizations as images with high resolution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `numpy`

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gas-prices-plotting.git
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

## Output

The project generates:

1. **Basic Line Plot**: Customizable line plot of `x` vs `y`.
2. **Gas Price Trends**: Comparative plot of gas prices across several countries.

## Data

The `gas_prices.csv` file includes gas price data by year for multiple countries.
